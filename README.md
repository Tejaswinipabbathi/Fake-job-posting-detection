# 🕵️ Fake Job Posting Detection

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether a job posting is **real or fake** using Natural Language Processing (**TF-IDF**) and a **Random Forest Classifier**.  
The model also applies **SMOTE** to handle imbalanced datasets.

## 📌 Features
- 🧹 Text preprocessing (cleaning, lowercasing, removing symbols)
- 🔤 Feature extraction with **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- ⚖️ Class balancing using **SMOTE**
- 🌲 Random Forest Classifier for training
- 📊 Model evaluation with **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**
- 🧪 Custom job posting input to test predictions
